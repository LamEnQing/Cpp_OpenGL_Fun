# What is this?
OpenGL Sandbox is a project where I can quickly write up codes or test codes from websites or Youtube videos.

In an isolated environment, solely focused on OpenGL, with no game engine abstraction over it. It makes the process of testing codes easier.

[Dear ImGui](https://github.com/ocornut/imgui) is also integrated into this project to quickly create GUIs to test the codes in a dynamic or fluid manner.

# I want to see your codes!
The codes are grouped into classes within `Main.cpp`. In the future, as more codes get added, these classes will be moved into their own source files.

# What does it have currently?
